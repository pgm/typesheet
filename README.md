A "typed" spreadsheet experiment



TODO:
    Need better exception reporting

    Add simple csv parser:
        Defines a property per column.  ("name" is treated specially)  Each is a string
        Define a class with those properties
        Insert records

    Define REST API
        - query
        - insert
        - update
        - delete

    Make js client which uses REST API to show table of results
